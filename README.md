# **Flashcard App**
As the name suggests, its a simple flashcard app, although that might be a overstatement, its hardly a app and isnt actually meant to be used to study or anything.
# Author
Hello, my name is Lucius. This project was done in order to help me learn front end development using Angular/Typescript.
I also have a youtube channel if you want to check out some of the other things ive worked on.

Probably the bare minimum for a flashcard app, I dont have any serious plans to continue development on this project, however maybe in the future I will add a little bit more to it.

# Lessons Learned
From this project I learned how to use HTML more efficiently by using bootstrap as well as the basics of front end developnment with Angular which I do have plans to do more projects with in the future. 

# Requirments
Bootstrap, Angular (sorry, I dont have a requirments file)
